# LSC 6.2.0 Preprint Package

Title:

**LSC 6.2.0: A Phenomenological Framework for Neutrino Propagation and Detector-Frame Tensor Anisotropy**

## Status

This is the latest preprint-stage version of the LSC research line.

The package is prepared for Zenodo archival and arXiv submission. The arXiv submission process is currently waiting for category endorsement, so this Zenodo package should be used as the stable citable preprint record while endorsement is pending.

arXiv endorsement request:

## Recommended Zenodo Strategy

Best continuity option:

Publish this as a **new version of the existing LSC 6.0 conceptual record**, not as a detached new project.

Base record:

- LSC 6.0 record: https://zenodo.org/records/19780616
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19780616
- Concept DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19780615

Reason:

- LSC 6.2.0 is explicitly a continuation of the LSC 6.0 phenomenological framework.
- The new work extends the model rather than replacing the public archive.
- Grant reviewers can see one continuous research line: LSC 4.2 -> LSC 5.x -> LSC 6.0 -> LSC v1.2.0 reproducibility update -> LSC 6.2.0 preprint.
- Zenodo versioning preserves continuity while assigning the 6.2.0 preprint its own version DOI.

## Scientific Framing

LSC 6.2.0 is not presented as confirmed new physics.

It is a phenomenological ansatz intended for independent review, numerical fitting and falsification. The main update is a detector-frame tensor anisotropy model that separates propagation effects from detector-level energy reconstruction.

## Conceptual Changes Since LSC 6.0

- Keeps the conservative LSC 6.0 propagation/reconstruction framing.
- Adds an explicit rank-2 detector-frame tensor `D_ij`.
- Separates true propagation energy from reconstructed detector energy.
- Defines the detector response:

```text
E_rec = E_true [1 + alpha_D D_ij p^i p^j]
```

- Uses a traceless anisotropy parameterization:

```text
D_ij = delta (n_i n_j - delta_ij / 3)
```

- Defines null recovery:

```text
D_ij -> 0
delta_G -> 0
```

- Maps the model to test classes:
  - angular anisotropy,
  - detector dependence,
  - energy-dependent residuals,
  - sidereal modulation.

- Identifies validation targets:
  - BEST / GALLEX / SAGE gallium source data,
  - KATRIN beta-spectrum constraints,
  - IceCube anisotropy and detector-systematic studies,
  - standard three-flavor oscillation limits.

## Recommended Public Wording

Short version:

> LSC 6.2.0 is the latest preprint-stage continuation of the LSC 6.0 phenomenological framework. It introduces detector-frame tensor anisotropy as a testable reconstruction-level ansatz. The work is not presented as confirmed new physics and is awaiting arXiv endorsement for formal submission.

Grant-facing version:

> LSC 6.2.0 extends the public LSC 6.0 record into an arXiv-ready preprint with explicit mathematical separation between propagation effects and detector-frame reconstruction anisotropy. The package provides a citable continuity point for grant review while the formal arXiv submission awaits category endorsement.
