## Notes

- mean source cross section, 51Cr: 5.749407e-45 cm^2
- mean source cross section, 37Ar: 7.011960e-45 cm^2
- the anchor fit is exact by construction, so leave-one-out is the real stability check
- the 6.2.2 revision separates isotropic trace from traceless anisotropy
- GALLEX source-by-source split remains a useful nuisance test
- the build also writes a simulation digest with term decomposition and directional scans
